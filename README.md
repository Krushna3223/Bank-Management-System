# 🏦 Bank Management System (My Learning Project)

This project started from **my original Python script `main.py`**,  
where I built a basic console-based banking system from scratch.

After that, I used ChatGPT to **upgrade and expand my project**,  
and created:

- `bank.py` → improved backend logic  
- `app.py` → Streamlit UI  
- `data.json` → local database  

This project is mainly for learning **Python, file structure, virtual environments, and Streamlit**.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
bank/
│
├── main.py        # My original bank system code (MOST IMPORTANT)
├── bank.py        # Improved backend logic (made later with GPT help)
├── app.py         # Streamlit UI version
├── data.json      # Database file
└── __init__.py
```

---

## ▶️ Run Streamlit UI

Open terminal in project root:

```
streamlit run bank/app.py
```

---

## ▶️ Run My Original Program

```
python bank/main.py
```

---

## 📝 Notes

- `main.py` is my own original code.
- `bank.py` and `app.py` were made later to upgrade the system.
- JSON is used to store account data.
- This project helped me understand **Python modules, JSON, Streamlit UI, and better code structure**.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This is a **learning project**, showing how a simple console program can evolve into a small app with UI and backend separation.
